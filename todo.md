# Backend (Needs the most work)
### Database
- What we need to put in the database:   
- We need to find out what **firebase** and **supabase** is...  
- Also how do we integrate a database into the project  
- We need to save users into a database  
- What is **RDMBS**, **Neon**, **postrgres**, **knex** **ORM**, we should know all of this


## Authentication
- We can't use Next Auth i think because we are using express in the backend

## Sockets
- Should just be able to to continue tutorial and look at socket.io documenation and it still should be good 
# FrontEnd (Just focus on backend for now)
